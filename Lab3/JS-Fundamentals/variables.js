// Copy the value from name to admin.
// Show the value of admin using alert (must output “John”).

//2 Give the right name

// Create a variable with the name of our planet. How would you name such a variable?
// Create a variable to store the name of a current visitor to a website. How would you name that variable?

let currentUser = "Nurs";

// 3 Uppercase const
// We use uppercase for values that never change in the code, like BIRTHDAY.

// AGE is calculated when the program runs, so it can change over time. That's why we keep it in lowercase.
